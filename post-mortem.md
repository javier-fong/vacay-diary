## Approach and Process

#### My process and approach
- Understanding what is the project scope and the requirements of the project
- Learning how to do a full CRUD app with Node.js/Express/MongoDB from Youtube for further understanding
- Started the app with landing page, followed by RESTful routes (except Edit, Update and Destroy routes), user login and registration route, and lastly the remaining routes (Edit, Update and Destroy)
- Once all the routes were established, additional features were added in e.g. Google Map, time zones and weather as well as better styling for the app

#### What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
I got stucked when doing the project halfway as I did not know how to do the authentication and I wanted to include it in my app. Since the user flow will be different if authentication was added in, I stopped coding my app and waited before authentication was being taught.

After learning how to do authentication, there was a lot of changes in my code.

Next time, before starting, I will need to understand the individual stacks better and if it will affect the codes.

#### What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
- YouTube, Google, asking for help from classmates and TA
- Having a clear picture of what I want in my app

## Code and Code Design

#### What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
- Including more comments for each function on what it does

#### What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
- Organising the codes and files in different folder makes it easier to find

## Unit 1 Post Mortem

#### What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
- Using Google, YouTube and asking for help from classmates and TA.
- Start early
- Make some time off everyday for coding of app (unexpected issues always occurs and it always take a lot of time to debug)

#### What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
- Going through the lessons beforehand to understand it better during class (sometimes did not have time to do so)

#### How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
1. The difficulty of unit 2 is acceptable, although it takes a longer time to understand the concept

2. I will need to practice more on TDD as still not good at it

3. Teaching have improved compared to unit 1
